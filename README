Newton Dynamics is an accurate 3d Physics Library for real-time simulation of physics environments. 
This library allows you to call it from Go code.

This library will be targeting the 300 version of Newton.

Quick Start
Build Newton (instructions here). Note, currently you need to build newton with 
DG_USE_THREAD_EMULATION defined (-DDG_USE_THREAD_EMULATION for gcc) as CGO 
doesn't currently support callbacks from non-native threads.

Run

go get bitbucket.org/tshannon/gonewton/newton

Then in your go code

import "bitbucket.org/tshannon/gonewton/newton"
